# Clifford Algebra quaternions, dual quaternions and 3D reflections with Pytorch
Implementation of dual quaternion transformation and blending. It requires ```pytorch```. It supports tensor of quaternions and dual quaternions.
In the `notebook` folder, a jupyter notebook gives some examples of the initialisation of dual quaternions.
